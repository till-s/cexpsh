Changes since CEXP-1.5
 2008/4/29:
 - Added toplevel Makefile rules 'rtemsbsp'/'rtemsbsp-install' which
   read Makefile.inc and configure the package using CPU flags and
   setting prefix/exec_prefix/includedir to match std. RTEMS layout.
 2008/3/22:
 - Fixed compiler warnings:
   * yyerror() now takes a 'const char *' argument.
   * declare 'ioctl' in rtems_hackdefs.h
 2008/3/21:
 - Fixed potential array overflow when composing cexp_main arglist.
   Thanks to smart gcc-4.3.0 who issued a warning :-)
 2008/3/20:
 - (build system): added --disable-libelf configure option
   which allows for building a system completely w/o loader
   -- needs a built-in symbol table, however.
 2008/1/6:
 - (xsyms/libelf) when cloning sections we should not just copy
	Elf_Data objects; the BSD libelf implementation has private
	fields beyond the public ones and these private fields.
	in particular, the 'data is malloced' flag) must not be
	copied blindly. Hence, we just copy the public (and relevant)
	fields explicitly.
 2007/10/16:
 - more recent gcc/gas use ELF section 'COMDAT' groups for 'linkonce'
   (rather than 'gnu.linkonce.xxx' sections).
   We now handle these (and do not re-load such groups anymore).
   Section symbols of group members now point to the instance first
   loaded.
   Note that prior to this change, 'linkonce groups' were loaded
   multiple times (but relocs always used the first instance, i.e.,
   we wasted memory but incurred no real problem).
   The old behavior for sections named '.gnu.linkonce.xxx' is still
   supported.
 2007/10/08:
 - added --with-newlib, --disable-multilib to configure options
   (when using top-level Makefile)
 2007/10/08:
 - replaced autoconf check which defined NO_THREAD_PROTECTION by
   simple #ifdef __rtems__ test.
 2007/10/08:
 - cache some more BFD info for the disassembler to make binutils-2.18
   work.
 2007/10/08:
 - libtecla 'install' failed to create man3, man4, ... subdirs.
 - add '-static' compiler flag when building the demo with gcc
 2007/2/14:
 - ported libtecla-1.6.1
 2005/12/16:
 - Bugfix: unary '-' operator on 'double' numbers scrambled the
   number's bit pattern (reported by Peter Dufault).
 2005/12/7:
 - Renamed 'cexp()' to 'cexpsh()' to avoid the name clash with
   POSIX cexp() (complex exponential). This is an API change -
   all applications calling 'cexp()' need to call 'cexpsh()' now.
 - Removed 'malloc()' declaration from spencer_regexp/regexp.c.
   #include <stdlib.h> instead (silenced warning).
 - Removed 80 char length limitation on string constants (was a
   parser limit). Now use a 1000 char buffer that is part of the
   parser context to assemble such strings (was 80 char buffer on
   stack).
 2005/11/5:
 - Updated README to explain how to use libcexp from a program.
 2005/11/4:
 - Created '--disable-opcodes' configure option. Updated README
   to give info about linker helper script generation with 
   xsyms -C.
 - Use clean-local: target to remove libelf local install dir.
 - elfsyms.c fix; remove obsolete free_regexp leftover.
 - updated tested configurations in INSTALL.
 2005/11/3:
 - Silenced compiler warnings (vars.c) by using appropriate 'lh'
   type. Use my_sigismember() to avoid conflict with declaration
   in header. Silenced more warnings.
 - Removed strncmp() from libiberty.

Changes since CEXP-1.4.beta ("Helvetia")
 2004/10/29:
 - BFD file loader now searches PATH environment variable for object
   files (non-absolute names only, of course).
 - plugged a few minor memory leaks
 2004/5/20:
 - New syntax: '< scriptfile' implemented
 - Implemented 'builtin' symbol tables. 'xsyms' can help generating
   a symbol table in C source form. (Similar support was added to
   the 'ldep' tool as well).
 - NOTE: THE INTERFACE DEFINED IN cexpHelp.h HAS SLIGHTLY CHANGED
   (help tables now need a 'module-specific' name qualifier). Thus,
   more than one table can be defined in a single file. It makes
   future 'directory' support easier.
 2004/3/5:
 - NOTE: THE INTERFACE TO cexpModuleInfo() (order of parameters)
         HAS CHANGED, SORRY.
 - Added support for m68k cache flushing (RTEMS only)
 - Help supporting GDB (in the future - not implemented yet) by
   keeping section address info. Using the 'gencore.c' utility
   (distributed separately - mail me), we can use GDB to analyze
   core dumps already, however. Added cexpModuleDumpGdbSectionInfo().
 - added verbosity level to cexpModuleInfo() [--> interface for
   that routine *changed* ]
 - small grammar bugfix: declaration of a new variable should
   only be executed if expression evaluation is not disabled
   (as a result of && ||). Impact is probably none as variable
   declarations are not allowed in such a context anyhow.
 - added a magic string to allow version checking of core files
   and binaries etc.

Changes since CEXP-1.3.beta ("good friday")

 2003/7/31:
 - added info about 'xsym' cross tool and updated configure
   magic to do real cross-builds for 'xsyms' (especially if
   using bfd. On a ELF host, it's OK to use a native libelf
   to build 'xsyms' for any ELF(32) target.
 - fixed BFD xsyms '.sym' extension handling.
 - added a architecture check to the BFD loader after getting
   obscure errors when trying to load x86 objects to a PPC
   system :-(
 - hacked libtecla so the 'newline' action passes nonprinting
   characters which ended the line along to the application.
   This can be used to implement 'hotkeys' (as used by the SVGM
   bootloader).
 - simplified HELP macro usage.

 2003/7/1:
 - moved more routines to the public interface:
     cexpModuleName(),
     cexpModuleFindByName(),
     cexpModuleInfo(),
     cexpSymLookup(),
     cexpSymLkAddr(),
 - added routines to access CexpSym internals:
     cexpSymName(),
     cexpSymValue()

 2003/5/20:
 - scanned README for 'who' constructs
 - bfdstuff.c: print more verbose relocation error messages
 - teclastuff.c: bugfix - searching for identifier start character
                          must skip ISIDENTCHAR() a la 'cexp.y'
   this fixes incorrect 'tab completion' when symbol names contain
   digits etc.

 2003/4/25:
 - added a warning (ELF only) when we find a ".fixup", ".got" or ".got2"
   section - they probably compiled a module with -fPIC...

Changes since CEXP-1.2.beta ("valentine")

 2003/4/23:
 - case handling for gcc/libc with __dso_handle and no __cxa_finalize was
   incorrect
 - assert ( ! (presence of __cxa_finalizer without __dso_handle) )
 - reject presence of __dso_handle without __cxa_finalizer with
   a warning
 - mandrake linux 9.1 / gcc-3.2.2 uses __cxa_atexit / __cxa_finalize
   for C++ static destructors.
   We now support __cxa_atexit / __cxa_finalize :-)

 2003/4/19:
 - implemented cexpResizeTerminal()

 2003/4/18:
 - use $(BISON) and  $(AUTOxxx) variables with obvious defaults
 - fixed solaris /bin/sh incompatibility issue

 2003/4/16:
 - unbundled 'libelf' and provided a BFD based
   version of 'xsyms'.
 - Toplevel 'Makefile' with rules 'prep' and 'xsyms'
   to call autotools, bison etc. and trivial 'xsyms'
   compilation (needs host-installed libelf or libbfd),
   respectively.
 - made spencer_regexp library reentrant
 - use a wrapper to invoke regexp. Could use 'libiberty'
   implementation but it is ~25k bigger and would need
   some wrapping work.
 - catch attempts to use cexpModuleLoad() when built
   with LIBELF.
