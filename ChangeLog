Changes since CEXP-2.0.beta
 2011/08/04:
 - Makefile.am: export host_alias, host_os, and host_cpu.
 2011/07/15:
 - cexp.c: set terminal to VMIN/VTIME=1/0 in native readline (no readline, no tecla).
 2011/07/15:
 - Makefile.am: export rtems_bsp, RTEMS_BSP, enable_rtemsbsp, package_subdir
   variables so third-party makefiles 'inherit' them (in case any is embedded
   in an installation path/prefix).
 2010/06/10:
 - configure.ac: check for multilibbed cpukit only if host_os is RTEMS.
 2010/05/06:
 - Makefile.am:
    o enforce linking undefined symbols needed by test modules (demo program)
    o link demo with CXX
 - bfdstuff.c: BUGFIX -- Ignore relocations that refer to a symbol in a
               discarded linkonce section.
               This should also fix a problem reported by Luciano Piccoli where
               a module refused to load because the .eh_frame section
               had a relocation referring to the section name of a discarded
               linkonce. Since that section had been folded into .text in
               the main executable it could not be found.
               During testing I also found that just relocating to the
               previous instance of a linkonce section is incorrect because
               to compiler would sometimes generate slightly different code
               resulting in different section sizes (original vs. discarded
               linkonce). Unless the relocation referring the discarded linkonce
               is ignored (-> value 0 which is in turn ignored by the libgcc
               run-time code) a bad/incorrect exception frame could be registered.
 - cexp.c:    Added 'sigaction' handler which prints offending SIGSEGV address.
 - cexpmod.c:
    o BUGFIX -- 'addrInModule()' algorithm skipped system module which
      is never associated with any segment. Thus 'lkaddr()' never found
      anything located in the main executable :-(
    o BUGFIX -- when a module is unloaded (linux demo) then we cannot
      just revoke 'executable' memory permission; the module memory is
      not page aligned and therefore 'x' could be removed from adjacent
      'live' module. Just always leave executable permission on...
 - configure.ac, Makefile.am, cpptest/*.c, cpptest/*.cc, cpptest/Makefile.am,
   cpptest/st.test: Added test code. So far, loading of common symbols, 
   linkonce sections, c++ exceptions and constructor/destructor ordering
   are tested.
 - configure.ac: Check for availability of HAVE_SIGNALS, HAVE_SIGINFO
   on non-rtems systems.
 - m4/rtems-tools.m4: Look for 'nm' utility, too. 
 
 2010/03/17:
 - bfdstuff.c: Completely ignore zero-sized sections marked SEC_ALLOC
   (by removing the SEC_ALLOC flag) so that no section symbol is
   recorded. Since no space is allocated for such a section the 
   value of a section symbol would be invalid and this results in
   gdb confusion...
 2010/02/17:
 - libtecla/getline.c: always include <sys/ioctl.h> (also under __rtems__)
   in order to get TIOCGWINSZ.
   Maintain 'signals_overridden' flag also under __rtems__.
 2010/02/07:
 - libtecla/configure.in: added --enable-ansiterm configure option (enabled
   by default for RTEMS if not explicitly disabled and disabled by default
   on other OSes) to avoid dependency on curses/termcap (assuming ANSI
   terminal).
 2009/12/14:
 - BUGFIX: cexpsh("script") would not terminate because of missing 'else'
   in nested if (which should have been 'else if'). This was a new bug
   introduced with the '-c' option.
 2009/12/04:
 - fixed all reduce/reduce and some shift/reduce conflicts in
   the grammar.
 - added stdio redirection.
 - deprecated '<' for sourceing scripts; should now use '.'
 - now have a dedicated FILE descriptor for parser error messages
   (can be passed to cexpCreateParserCtx())
 - added new callback argument to cexpCreateParserCtx() which
   allows the user to be notified when stdio redirection occurs.
 - added new '-c' option instructing cexpsh() to parse the option
   string argument.
 2009/12/02:
 - pmelf: bugfix in PPC attribute matcher;
 - pmelf: added support for Tag_GNU_Power_ABI_Struct_Return.
 - bfdstuff.c: added undocumented global variable
   '_cexpForceIgnoreObjAttrMismatches' which can be set to nonzero
   in order to force the BFD loader to ignore object attribute
   mismatches.
 2009/06/25: 
 - pmelf: added basic support for SPARC

Changes since CEXP-1.6.beta

 2008/10/8:
 - Removed most targets from toplevel 'Makefile' (were broken by latest
   changes). User must use 'configure' him-/herself.
 2008/10/8:
 - Added support for loading modules with weak undefined symbols
   (we treat them like newly defined COMMON symbols).
 2008/10/7:
 - Added checks dealing with zero-sized memory segments.
 - Added support for getting result + status of last evaluation.
 - Set special user-var 'ans' to result of last successful
   evaluation.
 2008/10/7:
 - BUGFIX: floating-point numbers w/o fractional part (e.g., 20. 0.) were
   not scanned correctly.
 2008/10/4:
 - Added changeable prompt (but no smart substitutions available [yet])
 2008/7/25:
 - With multiple memory regions/segments cexpSymLkAddrIdx() (and derived functions)
   cannot simply look at the first+last entry in the 'aindex' to determine if
   a given module contains an address location. Added code that checks the module's
   memory segment boundaries.
 2008/7/25:
 - Made (PPC) text segment size a 'configure' option '--enable-text-segment'.
 2008/7/25:
 - Disable PPC/SYSV-specific method of passing floating-point arguments
   to called function if _SOFT_FLOAT is defined (cannot pass in FP regs,
   in this case).
 2008/7/23:
 - added support for multiple memory segments. PPC text sections can
   now be loaded into dedicated text segment located below 32M boundary.
   (Total size of all text in all modules is still limited to 32M.)
 - 'cplusplusified' public headers.

Changes since CEXP-1.5

 2008/4/29:
 - Added toplevel Makefile rules 'rtemsbsp'/'rtemsbsp-install' which
   read Makefile.inc and configure the package using CPU flags and
   setting prefix/exec_prefix/includedir to match std. RTEMS layout.
 2008/4/17:
 - new LICENSE; we now use the SLAC license instead of the EPICS open
   license.
 2008/4/16:
 - removed support for libelf; we now use pmelf when appropriate.
 - added multilib support. libcexp, libtecla, libspencer_regexp and
   libpmbfd/libpmelf can be built as multilibs.
   NOTE: 'real' BFD does not support multilibs and hence we cannot
   use them if BFD is to be used.
 2008/4/15:
 - added Makefile.am/configure.ac magic to support new pmelf.
   FIXME: THIS NEEDS CLEANUP
 - xsyms-bfd.c now also can use pmbfd/pmelf. (But for binary symbol
   table generation objcopy --extract-symbol should be used.)
 2008/4/15:
 - (cexp.c): improved trivial 'readline' emulation (when no tecla or readline
   is configured) by switching terminal to RAW mode; we can then use backspace
   for erasing chars, CTRL-U to kill a line, ...
 2008/4/7:
 - (bfdstuff.c): 
   o access members of asection struct only through bfd_get_section_xxx()
     and bfd_set_section_xxx() macros.
   o changed code to read ELF specific symbol parameters from macros
     into inlines and renamed them.
   o BUGFIX: I believe the alignment of new common symbols was not
     determined correctly; the alignment is stored in the symbol value
	 (not size). We now use internal_elf_sym->st_value as the alignment.
   o silenced some compiler warnings (bad printf format string) by
     using l modifier and explicit casts to long variants.
   o NEW: Added test when loading common symbols to make sure that the
     alignment and size of a common symbol with the same name defined
	 in a new module matches the respective parameters of an existing
	 definition (created by previously loaded module).
   o BUGFIX: (bug triggered only if DEBUG & DEBUG_COMMON) when printing
     name of a new common symbol we must not use the name field of
	 the newly created empty symbol (which is NULL) but the name of
	 the existing symbol which is about to be cloned.
   o removed bfd_get_arch/bfd_get_mach and conversion to printable
     string. Seems sets these to 'unknown' anyways if we don't explicitly
	 tell it what arch/mach we are using (had hoped BFD tells us what
	 it learns from info in the file to be loaded).
 2008/3/22:
 - Fixed compiler warnings:
   * yyerror() now takes a 'const char *' argument.
   * declare 'ioctl' in rtems_hackdefs.h
 2008/3/21:
 - Fixed potential array overflow when composing cexp_main arglist.
   Thanks to smart gcc-4.3.0 who issued a warning :-)
 2008/3/20:
 - (build system): added --disable-libelf configure option
   which allows for building a system completely w/o loader
   -- needs a built-in symbol table, however.
 2008/1/6:
 - (xsyms/libelf) when cloning sections we should not just copy
	Elf_Data objects; the BSD libelf implementation has private
	fields beyond the public ones and these private fields.
	in particular, the 'data is malloced' flag) must not be
	copied blindly. Hence, we just copy the public (and relevant)
	fields explicitly.
 2007/10/16:
 - more recent gcc/gas use ELF section 'COMDAT' groups for 'linkonce'
   (rather than 'gnu.linkonce.xxx' sections).
   We now handle these (and do not re-load such groups anymore).
   Section symbols of group members now point to the instance first
   loaded.
   Note that prior to this change, 'linkonce groups' were loaded
   multiple times (but relocs always used the first instance, i.e.,
   we wasted memory but incurred no real problem).
   The old behavior for sections named '.gnu.linkonce.xxx' is still
   supported.
 2007/10/08:
 - added --with-newlib, --disable-multilib to configure options
   (when using top-level Makefile)
 2007/10/08:
 - replaced autoconf check which defined NO_THREAD_PROTECTION by
   simple #ifdef __rtems__ test.
 2007/10/08:
 - cache some more BFD info for the disassembler to make binutils-2.18
   work.
 2007/10/08:
 - libtecla 'install' failed to create man3, man4, ... subdirs.
 - add '-static' compiler flag when building the demo with gcc
 2007/2/14:
 - ported libtecla-1.6.1
 2005/12/16:
 - Bugfix: unary '-' operator on 'double' numbers scrambled the
   number's bit pattern (reported by Peter Dufault).
 2005/12/7:
 - Renamed 'cexp()' to 'cexpsh()' to avoid the name clash with
   POSIX cexp() (complex exponential). This is an API change -
   all applications calling 'cexp()' need to call 'cexpsh()' now.
 - Removed 'malloc()' declaration from spencer_regexp/regexp.c.
   #include <stdlib.h> instead (silenced warning).
 - Removed 80 char length limitation on string constants (was a
   parser limit). Now use a 1000 char buffer that is part of the
   parser context to assemble such strings (was 80 char buffer on
   stack).
 2005/11/5:
 - Updated README to explain how to use libcexp from a program.
 2005/11/4:
 - Created '--disable-opcodes' configure option. Updated README
   to give info about linker helper script generation with 
   xsyms -C.
 - Use clean-local: target to remove libelf local install dir.
 - elfsyms.c fix; remove obsolete free_regexp leftover.
 - updated tested configurations in INSTALL.
 2005/11/3:
 - Silenced compiler warnings (vars.c) by using appropriate 'lh'
   type. Use my_sigismember() to avoid conflict with declaration
   in header. Silenced more warnings.
 - Removed strncmp() from libiberty.

Changes since CEXP-1.4.beta ("Helvetia")
 2004/10/29:
 - BFD file loader now searches PATH environment variable for object
   files (non-absolute names only, of course).
 - plugged a few minor memory leaks
 2004/5/20:
 - New syntax: '< scriptfile' implemented
 - Implemented 'builtin' symbol tables. 'xsyms' can help generating
   a symbol table in C source form. (Similar support was added to
   the 'ldep' tool as well).
 - NOTE: THE INTERFACE DEFINED IN cexpHelp.h HAS SLIGHTLY CHANGED
   (help tables now need a 'module-specific' name qualifier). Thus,
   more than one table can be defined in a single file. It makes
   future 'directory' support easier.
 2004/3/5:
 - NOTE: THE INTERFACE TO cexpModuleInfo() (order of parameters)
         HAS CHANGED, SORRY.
 - Added support for m68k cache flushing (RTEMS only)
 - Help supporting GDB (in the future - not implemented yet) by
   keeping section address info. Using the 'gencore.c' utility
   (distributed separately - mail me), we can use GDB to analyze
   core dumps already, however. Added cexpModuleDumpGdbSectionInfo().
 - added verbosity level to cexpModuleInfo() [--> interface for
   that routine *changed* ]
 - small grammar bugfix: declaration of a new variable should
   only be executed if expression evaluation is not disabled
   (as a result of && ||). Impact is probably none as variable
   declarations are not allowed in such a context anyhow.
 - added a magic string to allow version checking of core files
   and binaries etc.

Changes since CEXP-1.3.beta ("good friday")

 2003/7/31:
 - added info about 'xsym' cross tool and updated configure
   magic to do real cross-builds for 'xsyms' (especially if
   using bfd. On a ELF host, it's OK to use a native libelf
   to build 'xsyms' for any ELF(32) target.
 - fixed BFD xsyms '.sym' extension handling.
 - added a architecture check to the BFD loader after getting
   obscure errors when trying to load x86 objects to a PPC
   system :-(
 - hacked libtecla so the 'newline' action passes nonprinting
   characters which ended the line along to the application.
   This can be used to implement 'hotkeys' (as used by the SVGM
   bootloader).
 - simplified HELP macro usage.

 2003/7/1:
 - moved more routines to the public interface:
     cexpModuleName(),
     cexpModuleFindByName(),
     cexpModuleInfo(),
     cexpSymLookup(),
     cexpSymLkAddr(),
 - added routines to access CexpSym internals:
     cexpSymName(),
     cexpSymValue()

 2003/5/20:
 - scanned README for 'who' constructs
 - bfdstuff.c: print more verbose relocation error messages
 - teclastuff.c: bugfix - searching for identifier start character
                          must skip ISIDENTCHAR() a la 'cexp.y'
   this fixes incorrect 'tab completion' when symbol names contain
   digits etc.

 2003/4/25:
 - added a warning (ELF only) when we find a ".fixup", ".got" or ".got2"
   section - they probably compiled a module with -fPIC...

Changes since CEXP-1.2.beta ("valentine")

 2003/4/23:
 - case handling for gcc/libc with __dso_handle and no __cxa_finalize was
   incorrect
 - assert ( ! (presence of __cxa_finalizer without __dso_handle) )
 - reject presence of __dso_handle without __cxa_finalizer with
   a warning
 - mandrake linux 9.1 / gcc-3.2.2 uses __cxa_atexit / __cxa_finalize
   for C++ static destructors.
   We now support __cxa_atexit / __cxa_finalize :-)

 2003/4/19:
 - implemented cexpResizeTerminal()

 2003/4/18:
 - use $(BISON) and  $(AUTOxxx) variables with obvious defaults
 - fixed solaris /bin/sh incompatibility issue

 2003/4/16:
 - unbundled 'libelf' and provided a BFD based
   version of 'xsyms'.
 - Toplevel 'Makefile' with rules 'prep' and 'xsyms'
   to call autotools, bison etc. and trivial 'xsyms'
   compilation (needs host-installed libelf or libbfd),
   respectively.
 - made spencer_regexp library reentrant
 - use a wrapper to invoke regexp. Could use 'libiberty'
   implementation but it is ~25k bigger and would need
   some wrapping work.
 - catch attempts to use cexpModuleLoad() when built
   with LIBELF.
