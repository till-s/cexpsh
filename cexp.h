 *       ancestor has a 'local' prompt set (either because
 *       the ancestor was started with '-p' or because
 *       cexpSetPrompt() was used) then the new shell
 *       'inherits' the ancestor's local prompt.
 *   3.) If a global prompt has been set it is used.
 *   4.) If the shell has a nonzero 'first' argument
 *       (argv[0]) then a '>' character is appended and
 *       the concatenation used as the prompt.
 *   5.) If steps 1..4 have not yielded a prompt then
 *       'Cexp>' is used as a fallback.
 *
 * The 'which' parameter controls how the prompt is set:
 *
 * CEXP_PROMPT_GBL: set the global prompt.
 * CEXP_PROMPT_LCL: set the prompt for the executing
 *                  shell only.

 * NOTE: No substitutions (hostname, history, pwd, ...)
 *       are supported yet.
