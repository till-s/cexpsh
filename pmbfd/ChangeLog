 20140224 (T.S.):
 - bfd-reloc-sparc.c: first stab at implementing relocations for sparc32.
 - pmelf.h: renamed R_SPARC_12 -> R_SPARC_13 which seems to be the correct
   name (sparc abi supplement vers. 9).
 20130123 (T.S.):
 - pmbfd.h, bfd.c: added 'elf_section_flags()' (should go to bfd-elf.h
   if we ever implement that).
 - pmbfd.h: added 'bfd_mach_ppc_vle' (for binutils/opcodes compat - no
   real support)
 - pmbfdP.h, bfd.c: reduced internal representation of 'align_power' to
   uint8_t. Added 'aux_flags' and AUX_ELF64 as a discrinator for the ELF
   section header (indicating whether it is 64 or 32-bit).
 - pmelf.h: added SHF_PPC_VLE (for binutils/opcodes compat - no real support).
 20130117 (T.S.):
 - pmbfd.h: added arch/mach definitions required to build with 
   binutils-2.13's/opcodes.
 20121101 (T.S.):
 - getehdr.c: check SH and PH sizes only if respective numbers are > 0.
 20120716 (T.S.):
 - pmbfd.h: tweaked some things so that opcodes from binutils-2.21 compiles
    o added definition for STRING_COMMA_LEN
    o added bfd_arch_l1om (and associated 'bfd_mach_l1om...' macros)
    o MODIFIED bfd_mach_powerpc and bfd_mach_rs6000 to match binutils-2.21
    o fixed typo in bfd_mach_rs6k... macros
 20120712 (T.S.):
 - added dmpphdr.c, getphdr.c, scnt.c to CVS (had forgotten)
 - pmelfP.h, strm.c, mstrm.c, fstrm.c: moved handling of 'noclose' arg to
   pmelf_delstrm() to individual stream method.
 - pmelf.h, pmelfP.h, strm.c, mstrm.c: added pmelf_mapstrm() which uses mmap
   when available.
 20120712 (T.S.):
 - strm.c, fstrm.c, mstrm.c, pmelfP.h, pmelf.h: added pmelf_tell().
 - Makefile.am, dmpphdr.c, getphdr.c, scnt.c, rdelf.c, getehdr.c,
   pmelf.h:
   initial/rudimentary support for program headers.
 - symtab.c, rdelf.c, dmpshdr.c, getshdr.c, findsymhdrs.c, pmelf.h:
   support for dynamic symbols
 - strm.c: let pmelf_delstrm() accept (and ignore) NULL stream argument.
 20120622 (T.S.):
 - pmelf.h:   Added definition for SHT_GNU_HASH
 - bfd.c:     Ignore/skip SHT_GNU_HASH
 - dmpshdr.c: Print string info for GNU section types.
 20100630 (T.S.):
 - configure.ac, bfd.c: Added test for <strings.h>. rtems-4.10/newlib-1.18
   declare strcasecmp() in <strings.h> (POSIX). Hence we include that
   if present.
 20091202 (T.S.):
 - att-gnu-powerpc.c: BUGFIX: scanning for ABI tags would access
   bad memory if tag was not present in object file. 
   Added Tag_GNU_Power_ABI_Struct_Return.
   Added GNU_Power_ABI_FP_SP_HARD (new value for FP tag).
 - attrP.h, attpbfasdestroy.c, att-gnu-powerpc.c, attpbfasmatch.c,
   attbpfasprint.c, attpbfasread.c, attset.c:
   Introduced new union combining 'public' and 'opaque' values.
   Previous implementation was wrong since it would not correctly
   store 'opaque' values (arrays assumed 'public' layout).
   The new union is now used in both, the array and list parts
   of an attribute table.
 - attrP.h, attset.c, att-gnu-powerpc.c: Added new function
   'pmelf_attribute_get_tag_val()' for retrieving the value associated
   with a particular tag.
 20090625 (T.S.):
 - bfd.c: Fixed conditional compilation in elf2bfdsec():
   If 64-bit support is enabled then the 32-bit code
   must still be compiled (there is a run-time test for
   64/32-bit).

 20090625 (T.S.):
 - bfd.c, dmpehdr.c, dmprels.c, getehdr.c, pmbfd.h,
   pmelf.h, bfd-reloc-sparc.c (stub only): Added basic
   support for SPARC (no relocations yet).

 20090625 (T.S.):
 - Added ChangeLog
 - minor 64-bit fixes:
   o getehdr.c: added missing 'break;' to switch
       statement in pmelf_getehdr().
   o dmprels.c: Fixed wrong member name
       (p_p_s64 -> p_s64) in dmprels.c
